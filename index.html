                    <p>
                        I'm an aspiring software developer with a passion for developing games. I love art in nearly all forms, from drawing, to music, to writing, to game development.
                        I love playing games as well, and not just video games. Board games, card games, and more are all passions of mine. I hope to one day have a massive repetoire
                        of game development experience so that I can build any game I can dream of.

                        An Enterprise Project for Neumont. We made a VR puzzle game with an arcade cabinet that affects the world around you, and vice versa. My first big project with a company, even though it was a small company.
                        It gave me quite a bit of experience with Unity VR, and the processes that go into it working correctly. Also gave me experience with a team, and the challenges that
                        come with trying to coordinate one.

                        of the game, as well as find and fix bugs within it. It was a project that helped me learn how to look for bugs in my own code and figure out a possible cause and
                        solution.

                        A fast-paced 2D platformer where you play as Dr. Güber, a genius, and slightly mad, scientist attempting to escape a nuclear reactor in meltdown. Inspired by pizza tower
                        and Wario Land, you have 5 minutes to escape. This was done for a 24-hour Neumont Game Jam, and was a good lesson in time management. I practiced my pixel art for this one,
                        making Dr. Güber and a little of the terrain.

                        A small sequel to 5 Minutes Til' Meltdown inspired by Super Mario 64. Also done for a 24-hour Neumont Game Jam, we attempted to make a game with fun interesting movement as
                        you ran from a mutated form of your father. While it didn't turn out exactly as we wanted it to, I'm still putting it on here because it served as a great practice experience.
                        It provided a wake up call when it came to proper time management and music composition, as well as practice with lighting and level design (even though it didn't make it into
                        the final game).

                        Another project made for a Neumnot Game Jam, this time a 72 hour one. We made a game that focused on making an intentional bug as part of the game, which we decided would be a movement
                        bug in which the more you move, the faster you went. This would eventually allow you to teleport through walls due to the vector based movement. This project elevated my experience with
                        creating character movement from scratch, and also forced me to think outside the box for a solution to certain mechanics.
